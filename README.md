 ##Summary
 An app built to provide a space for users to receive random  suggestions for activities as well as share their own.
 Users have the option of drawing activities from a global pool generated by all users, 
 or they can limit the possibilities to activities that they previously submitted themselves. In addition, the user can also limit the possible
 results to fit within a specific category such as learning, fitness, entertainment, chores, or socialize.
